## What does R Fundamentals cover?

<font size="5">

**R Fundamentals 1**

Get started with R and RStudio, working with variables to perform calculations 

**R Fundamentals 2**

Start working with vectors to perform summary statistics on data as well as accessing parts of your data (indexing)

**R Fundamentals 3**

An introduction to using text, factors (categorical data), and how to change the data type

**R Fundamentals 4**

Start using data frames which are like Excel spreadsheets in structure. We will cover how to use this important data type to perform summary statistics

**R Fundamentals 5**

Start loading data into R, and in the process learn about packages (extensions to R) and what how to work with pathways/directories

**R Fundamentals 6**

An introduction to conditional operators and logic, which we use to filter and categorise data

**R Fundamentals 7**

Start working with list and matrix data types, where we cover how to make, access data, and their general uses

Introduction to the tidyverse through dplyr and piping your workflow. We will be covering how to select columns and filter rows, as well as general tips along the way

**R Data Wrangling 2**

Start manipulating columns of data (creation, modification, or removal of columns) as well as cleaning up your column names. 

**R Data Wrangling 3**

An introduction to relational joins, cross tabulation, and aggregation (split, apply, combine)

**R Data Visualisation 1**
