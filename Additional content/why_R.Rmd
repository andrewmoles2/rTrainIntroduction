# Why R

R is a popular language, especially in data science and statistics.

This can be seen in the TIOBE Index for August 2020.

As well as the PYPL index from 2023.

R has lots of strengths:

-   Excellent at handling data
-   Very good for statistics
-   Open source
-   You can do almost anything in R due to community written 'packages'
-   Makes pretty and complex data visualisations (see below)
-   R Shiny is a great tool for making interactive dashboards and applications
-   R Markdown/Quarto are document writing tools that allow you to write all your analysis and text in one document
-   Interacts well with other languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C++

# Introduction to RStudio

RStudio by default has four main quadrants as shown below. The layout is customisable, as is the background.

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-1/Images/rstudioEnv.png?raw=true)

When you load RStudio the syntax editor will not be open. Try and open one just like as shown below.

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-1/Images/scripts.png?raw=true)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using R markdown

For these workshops we will be using R Markdown. It allows you to have text (with simple formatting) and chunks of R code.

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/main/r-fundamentals-1/Images/RMarkdown.png?raw=true)

To run code in a code chunk either press the green play button or press Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on Mac).

# Information on how the session is run

One hour exercise based session with tutor support. You will be given example code for a problem, then given a related exercise to complete.

## Why this style?

-   Online training is tiring so keeping the sessions to one hour
-   No or limited demonstrations provided in order to provide more real world experience - you have a problem and you look up how to solve it, adapting example code
-   Trainer support to guide through process of learning

## We will be working in pairs:

-   One shares the screen and the other requests remote control.
-   Take turns on who types for each exercise.
-   Share markdown file at end of session via chat
-   If possible have your camera on when doing the paired work.

## What to do when getting stuck:

1)  Ask your team members
2)  Search online:

-   The answer box on the top of Google's results page
-   <https://stackoverflow.com/> (for task-specific solutions)
-   <https://www.r-bloggers.com/> (topic based tutorials)
-   <https://www.w3schools.com/r/> (w3 schools short tutorials)

3)  Don't struggle too long looking online, ask the trainer if you can't find a solution!
