# What this workshop will cover

-   How to make box plots with ggplot2
-   Other options to bar and box plots
-   How to make histograms with ggplot2
-   Working with dates with the lubridate package
-   How to make time series line plots

## Why this style?

-   Online training is tiring so keeping the sessions to one hour
-   No or limited demonstrations provided in order to provide more real world experience - you have a problem and you look up how to solve it, adapting example code
-   Trainer support to guide through process of learning

## We will be working in pairs:

-   Option to work together on worksheet or to work individually
-   If possible have your camera on and introduce yourself to each other

## What to do when getting stuck:

1)  Ask your team members
2)  Search online:

-   The answer box on the top of Google's results page
-   stackoverflow.com (for task-specific solutions)
-   <https://www.r-bloggers.com/> (topic based tutorials)

3)  Don't struggle too long looking online, ask the trainer if you can't find a solution!
