# Objective of workshop

To start using loops (iteration), the act of sequentially repeating your code, to streamline your data cleaning and analysis in R. 

# What this workshop will cover

In this workshop, the aim is to cover how to start working with looping in R. We will be covering:

-   Introduce the use of for loops
-   Perform looping using apply functions
-   Perform looping using map functions

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ideas

- Pull most of what I wrote for looping and apply using palmer penguins. Need another good dataset for the exercises
- Need something on how to use map and why
