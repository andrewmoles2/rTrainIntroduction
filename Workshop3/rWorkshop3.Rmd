# What will this workshop cover?

In this workshop, the aim is to cover some basics of using variables and vectors in R, as well as a start on using strings. We will be covering:

*  String variables
*  String manipulation with Paste, gsub and grep
*  Introduction to factors (represent categorical data, ordered/un-ordered, levels)
*  Tabulation using factors
*  Converting types of data (strings, factors, integers, and numeric)

# Information on how the session is run

We will be working in pairs:

*  Take turns sharing the screen.
*  Take turns on who types for each exercise.
*  Whoever was typing, share your code in the chat with your teammate. 

What to do when getting stuck:

1)  Ask your team members
2)  Search online:
  *  The answer box on the top of Google's results page 
  *  stackoverflow.com (for task-specific solutions)
  *  https://www.r-bloggers.com/ (topic based tutorials)
3)  Don't struggle too long looking online, ask the trainer if you can't find a solution!

**To get feedback**: hand in your R markdown exercise file in the assignment on the Teams channel for the R 3 workshop.

# Strings
So far in our previous sessions we have only been working with numbers and integers. Strings are text based data which R calls characters. 

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/master/Workshop2/images/22895-NUNWT2.jpg?raw=true){width=50%}
 
To code a string you need to use quotation marks. You can use either single or double, depending on your preference. When printing the result, R will always use double quotation marks.
```{r}
instrument <- "Violin"
instruments <- c('Violin', 'Cello', 'Viola')
instruments
```
You have to be careful not to run functions on strings that need numerical data.

## Exercise
Using the notNumbers variable defined here:
```{r}
notNumbers <- c('2', '4', '8')
```
1)  Use the mean function on that variable
2)  Why did it not work?
3)  Can you find a function to change the notNumbers vector to be numeric? Try "searching character to numeric r".
4)  Once you've changed notNumbers to numeric, run mean on it again

## Is this a string or a number?
You can find out what type data your variable/vector is using the `class` function.
```{r}
name <- 'Claudia'
class(name)
age <- 42
class(age)
```

## String exercise

1)  Make a vector called orangeVeg with the following strings: Pumpkin, Carrot, Butternut Squash, Sweet Potato
2)  From orangeVeg select everything but carrot using indexing
3)  From orangeVeg select just Pumpkin and Butternut Squash

# Basic string manipulation
R comes with several useful functions for manipulating strings, these include `paste`, `paste0`, `grep`, `gsub`. `paste` and `paste0` are for creating strings, and `grep` and `gsub` for are string matching and replacement. 

Some examples of paste:
```{r}
trees <- c('Oak', 'Willow', 'Redwood')
paste(trees, collapse = ", ")
paste("Hi", "there", sep = ", ")
```
```{r}
pizzaEaten <- 4
paste0("This week I ate ", pizzaEaten, " pizzas...")
```
As you can see paste can make new strings from existing strings. 

## Paste exercise

1)  Make a vector with the following flowers: sunflower, poppy, dahlia
2)  Use `paste` to make this string: "sunflower, poppy, dahlia"
3)  Make a variable called daysRaining with the value 360
4)  Using `paste0` make the following sentence that uses the daysRaining variable: "It has been raining for 360 days this year"

## grep
We use `grep` for string matching. We give it the string or part of string we are looking for, and it will return where in the vector these strings are.
```{r}
places <- c(rep("Hampshire", 2), rep("London", 5), rep("Kent", 1), rep("Surrey", 3))
places
grep("London", places)

```
It is very useful for indexing strings.
```{r}
places[grep("Lon", places)]
```

## gsub
With `gsub` we give the function the patten we are looking to replace, what to replace it with, and the variable or vector to work on.
```{r}
Names <- c("Andrew", "Andrea", "Angela")
gsub("An" ,"" , Names)
```
Here we are removing the An from the names in the Names vector. 

## Exercise
For this exercise I have given you the code but it is in the wrong order. You need to re-arrange the code so it runs correctly. Comment on what each line of code is doing. 

The end result you are aiming for is: **"These 4 pokemon have 'ar' in their names: Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Wartortle"**

```{r eval=FALSE}
pokemon <- gsub("[0-9]", "", pokemon)

paste0("These ",arPokes_num, " pokemon have 'ar' in their names: ", arPokes)

arPokes_num <- sum(length(arPokes))

arPokes <- pokemon[grepl("ar", pokemon)]

pokemon <- c("Bulbasaur001", "Ivysaur002", "Venusaur003",
             "Charmander004", "Charmeleon005", "Charizard006",
             "Squirtle007", "Wartortle008", "Blastoise009")

arPokes <- paste(arPokes, collapse = ", ")
```
