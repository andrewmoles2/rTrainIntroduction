# What is the tidyverse?

# What is tidy data? 

Give an example of tidy data and untidy data (with actual or made data)

# Intro to pipes

The pipe operator is for chaining a sequence of operations together.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

# 20 randomly selected data points, from 1 to 10
x <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)
y <- sample(1:10, 20, replace = TRUE)

# magrittr pipe
x_mean <- x %>%
  mean() %>%
  round(digits = 2)

x_mean

# naive R pipe
y_mean <- y |>
  mean() |>
  round(digits = 2)

y_mean
```
