# What will this workshop cover?

The goal of this session is to get to start using RStudio, learn how to use variables and solve basic calculations in R. We will cover:

*  Introduction to RStudio
*  Using r as a calculator
*  Numerical variables
*  Assigning variables
*  Vectors

# Information on how the session is run

We will be doing paired programming, to work together:

*  One shares the screen and the other requests remote control.
*  Take turns on who types for each exercise.
*  At the end save the script/markdown document and share it with your teammate in the chat.

What to do when getting stuck:

1)  Ask your team members
2)  Search online:
  *  The answer box on the top of Google's results page 
  *  stackoverflow.com (for task-specific solutions)
  *  https://www.r-bloggers.com/ (topic based tutorials)
3)  Ask the trainer if you struggle to find a solution

# Why R 

R is a popular language, as shown in the TIOBE index. 
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="TIOBE Index for August 2020"}
knitr::include_graphics("tiobe-index.png")
```

*  Excellent at handling data
*  Very good for statistics
*  Open source
*  Can do almost anything in R due to community written 'packages'
*  Makes pretty and complex data visualisations (see below)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Credit: Christian Burkhart @ChBurkhart"}
knitr::include_graphics("examplePlot_cBurkhart.jpeg")
```

# Introduction to RStudio

RStudio by default has four main quadrants as shown below. The layout is customisable, as is the background. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudioEnv.png")
```

When you load RStudio the syntax editor will not be open. Try and open one just like as shown below.
```{r echo=FALSE, scripts}
knitr::include_graphics("scripts.png")
```

# Starting the session

**can I sent or share files with students?** 

Open the workshop1.rmd file 

*show picture here with text on code chunks and text, using the file I have made*

# Using R as a calculator

We can use R to do simple or advanced calculations for us. 

```{r}
2 + 2
10 / 5
0.25 - 0.04
```

```{r}
7 * 6
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy-Diagram-of-Everything-Shirt.jpg")
```

```{r}
5 / (2^2)
(16 - 4) + (1 * 9)
```

## Exercises 1

Use R to work out the following arithmetic:

1)  44 * 26
2)  Find the BMI calculation online, use R to work out a BMI 

```{r}
# BMI
92/(1.94^2)
```

## Exercises 2

Another simple calculation
