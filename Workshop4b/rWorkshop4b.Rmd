# What will this workshop cover?

In this workshop, the aim is to cover how to load and work with data frames, as well as an introduction to packages. We will be covering:

*  Introduction to packages
*  Introduction to directories and projects
*  Loading in data
*  Exporting data

# Information on how the session is run

One hour exercise based session with tutor support. You will be given example code for a problem, then given a related exercise to complete.

## Why this style?

*  Online training is tiring so keeping the sessions to one hour
*  No or limited demonstrations provided in order to provide more real world experience - you have a problem and you look up how to solve it, adapting example code
*  Trainer support to guide through process of learning

## We will be working in pairs:

*  Option to work together on worksheet or to work individually
*  If possible have your camera on and introduce yourself to each other

## What to do when getting stuck:

1)  Ask your team members
2)  Search online:
  *  The answer box on the top of Google's results page 
  *  stackoverflow.com (for task-specific solutions)
  *  https://www.r-bloggers.com/ (topic based tutorials)
3)  Don't struggle too long looking online, ask the trainer if you can't find a solution!

# Introduction to packages

Packages are collections of functions, code, and sample data put together by the R community. Packages are one of the main benefits of R. As R is open source there can be lots of contributors who have made functions to do complex tasks, such as data cleaning, specific types of data analysis, or exciting data visualisation.

To install these packages onto your computer you have to download them from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). 

![](https://github.com/andrewmoles2/rTrainIntroduction/blob/master/Workshop4a/images/CRAN.png?raw=true){width=30%}

There are two ways of doing this, using code (recommended and easiest) or using the menus (Tools > Install Packages). 

Using code involves using the install packages function, which looks like: `install.packages("package name")`. To install the package you would type something like:`install.packages("readr")`.

Once installed, you will not need to do this again unless you install a newer version of R. 

## Installing packages task

Try installing the following packages:`readr`, `readxl`, `writexl`, and `here` using the `install.packages()` function. We will be using these in today's session. 

```{r}
# your code here

```

## Loading packages

Now you have installed the packages, you need to load them so you can use them. **Each time you load R you will need to re-load the packages you want to use**. 

To load a package you need to use the `library()` function. For example, if I wanted to load the `readr` package I would type `library(readr)`.

## Loading packages task

Using `library()` load in the packages you just installed: `readr`, `readxl`, `writexl`, and `here`.

```{r}
# your code here

```

If you are not sure what packages are loaded, you can use `sessionInfo()`. Run the code below to test it out. Under *other attached packages* you should see readr, readxl, writexl, and here. 
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

# Introduction to directories

A directory is a file path on your computer, known as the working directory. It tells R where to find files to load or save files out of R. Directories work in a top down hierarchical manner. 

To find out where your working directory is in R you can use `getwd()`. 

Run the code below, the output should be the file your rWorkshop4b.Rmd is saved in. 
```{r}
getwd()
```

# Introduction to RStudio Projects

A project is a centralised place to keep all your files for a study, piece of work, or 'project'. When you start a new Project it sets up a working directory in a fresh R session. Because the project sets up the working directory and keeps all your project related files in one place, it makes managing your files and analysis much easier, and helps you to share your code with collaborators or supervisors. 

*note: you can also change your working directory using the setwd() function, but in the long run it can be difficult to manage. E.g. if a file moves or gets deleted* 

## How to set up a project? 

*File > New Project...*

## Project task

1) Set up a project for this workshop in either a file you have already created or a new file. 
2) Go to your newly created folder in either File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac). 
3) Put your rWorkshop4b.Rmd file in your project directory (if you have not do so already).
4) Add a new file called data, and add in the data files for the session (). 

Run both examples below, you should get the same file path and the file file should be the project file you just made. 
```{r}
getwd()
here()
```

# Loading in data

Loading data is how you will be getting data into R most of the time! R can handle many different file types thanks to packages built by the R community. These include .csv, .xlsx, .sav, .dta. 

Data can be loaded into R either from files from your computer, using directories to find them, or the internet using URLs. 

When loading data from your computer it is good practise to make sure your data file is in the same directory as your rWorkshop4.Rmd file. Make sure you save both the .csv and .xlsx file in the same file as your .Rmd. 

If you are not sure if your data file is in the same directory as this notebook run the below command to list the files in your directory. This command should print out *pokemonGen1.csv*, *pokemonGen1.xlsx*, *pokemonGen2.csv*, *pokemongen2.xlsx*, *rWorkshop4.Rmd*, plus any other files you have saved in that file. 
```{r}
list.files(here("Workshop4b", "data"))
```

We are going to load in a .csv file and a .xlsx file, two of the most common file types to be loaded into R. 

**hint: an RStudio shortcut to find files is to press tab when the cursor is in the speech marks ("")**
```{r}

```

## Loading data task

# Exporting data

# Other options for loading data

It is useful to mention the `data.table` package, which is very good at loading large csv files with its `fread()` function. 

A typical project folder will have several sub-folders such as code (for scripts), data (for your data files), and outputs (for your figures). 

Run the code below to see an example data science file system. Projects are usually at the analysis stage (blue boxes). 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(here)
knitr::include_graphics(here("Workshop4b","images", "fileSys.png"))
```

# Final task - Please give us your individual feedback!

This is the first time that we are exploring a remote learning format for our workshops and we would be grateful if you could take 2 mins before the end of the workshop to get your feedback!

# Individual take home challenge 

```{r}
# Load in data from url > do a bit of indexing > make a new col etc. 
```
